	/*========================================================= COMPULSORY TASK =======================================================

		  It's now time for you to make your own program. 
		 	
		  Using examples shown in the example program, write code below to do the following:
		   
			  Create four variables, using the appropriate data type (String, double, int or char) and have them store:
			   - Your first name
			   - Your age
			   - Your approximate height in centimeters (decimal)
			   - Your favourite whole number
			 
		  Output this data on separate lines with a tabbed spacing (eg: First name:      Joe)
		  You'll need to use 4 seperate System.out.println statements to do this, each adding your variable to a String to outprint them.
		  
		  Don't forget to compile and run your code to test the output. 
			  
		 If you need any help, be sure to let the teachers know by sending an email to help@hyperiondev.com or by leaving a message in your Dropbox.  
		 
		 If your code is correct, you'll get to move on to the next task. Good luck!
