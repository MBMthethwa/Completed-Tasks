Hi Masood,

Interview feedback
==================

Test was good, most of the question i knew. questions was Java Standard Edition (SE) 6 questions.
I do not remember axactly questions but it was More like the Exam803–SampleQuestions.pdf on my folder. 
I think I failed an interview because of maybe I am lacking communication skills.(I mean sell myself to an interviewer) I cannot express myself.
I have to make sure that I know java keyword like why we use static when we declare a
variable and why are we using threds etc. I think, I passed a test but I want to see my result so that I can know what to improve. 
I can be glad if I can see my result for a IKM test.

Suggestion
----------

Mayb we should have a practice before interview so that will be able to sell ourselves to an interviewer.
